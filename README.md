### Hi!
This program was written with python 3.6 and tests use Pytest (see requirements.txt).
The main rpn function will be redesigned soon.
### Usage
1) run script
2) pass in an expression (operands and operators must be separated by spaces)
>>> ( 45 - 5 ) * 2 - 86 / 3
3) operations are currently available: +, -, *, /

### Importing
you can import a <b>calc</b> function to your projects<br>
Usage:<br>
y = calc('( 45 - 5 ) * 2 - 86 / 3')
